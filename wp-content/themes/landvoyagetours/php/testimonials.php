 Yeah, it was so nice trip with your kind Assistance , you just made my days .
As you know I have traveled different locations in kerala and every location has its different specialty.
Starts from Cochin honestly I didn’t get much time for sightseeing I have just visit Chinese Fishing net and other things was closed till I reach and I feel Cochin is just for Arrival spot to reach KERALA.
Munnar relay its God’s own city I have never seen that level greenery in my life, Munnar is perfect place for honeymoon or we can say for relaxation.
Thekkedy it was good but i was disappointed there in thekkedy  , because  till we reach for boating the ticket counter was closed , it could be better if you Arrange boating tickets as well in package till guests reach the location , to avoid such disappointments .
Alleppy its life time experience in house boat my girl was completely impressed by me, we had small boat ride also and the candle light dinner was so romantic.
Mararikullam the resort and private beach was too good as I expected, I just spent my time in beach.
Coming to your service, firstly I am thankful to you and for your patience, you discussed with me for long time patiently, the hotels you arranged very neat and hygienic except Jungle Park. But I appreciate for their honesty we were on the way to Alleppy the hotel management called me to inform that I forgot my Mobile in Hotel , then I go back to collect .
Lastly Vishnu my driver he is just Awesome, and very skilled driver I must say.
Please keep up the work , i wish you all the very best  .
